# RoboSapper
 Plugin that allows players to sap human players in MvM.

This is a recreation of the RoboSapper mechanic in Mann vs. Machine, now for human players on the Blue team. Code is based on what I've seen in [Robosapper2](https://github.com/TehPlayer14/Robosapper2) and the _tf_obj_sapper.cpp_ file.
